  abstract = {The computer software package TURBOVEG (for Microsoft® Windows®) was developed in The Netherlands for the processing of phytosociological data. This package comprises an easy-to-use data base management system. The data bank to be managed can be divided into several data bases which may consist of up to 100 000 relevés each. The program provides methods for input, import, selection, and export of relevés. In 1994, TURBOVEG was accepted as the standard computer package for the European Vegetation Survey. Currently it has been installed in more than 25 countries throughout Europe and overseas.},
