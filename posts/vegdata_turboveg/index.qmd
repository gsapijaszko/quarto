## Introduction

**Turboveg for Windows**\index{\textbf{Turboveg}}[^1] is a program designed for the storage, selection, and export of vegetation data (relevés). For more information please refer to @hennekensTURBOVEGComprehensiveData2001 and/or author's [homepage](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/).

[^1]: Currently using `Turboveg for Windows 2.155` available from [author's website](https://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/)

Please note: **Turboveg** uses **dBase** database file system for storing the observations. Please use `Pack & Reindex` option from the `Database` menu. In fact, it purges (deletes) all marked for deletion records from the database. It's essential to do it as a routine when you modify/delete the species from your plots. Otherwise it will be still in the database, and visible to **R**.

In this example we will get the data from **Turboveg**, prepare vegetation matrix, compute few indices and plot them.

## Data access and preparation

For data access we will use `vegdata` package [@vegdata2010]. It handles vegetation data from different sources, including **Turboveg** and allows to run taxonomic harmonization with appropriate taxonomic list. **Turboveg** provides different abundance codes lists, which can be also extended by user. Data is stored in `tvscale.dbf` file. To perform vegetation analysis a kind of mapping between abundance codes and numerical values is required. For this purpose the data base file contain the mean cover percentage values. `vegdata` provides a `tv.coverperc` function for automatic conversion. For example, the often used Braun--Blanquet scale @braun-blanquet_pflanzensoziologie_1964 is shown in table @tbl-bbT.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-bbT
#| tbl-cap: caption = "Modified Braun-Blanquet (old) scale")

bbT <- data.frame(
  Scale = as.character(c("r", "$+$", 1:5, "x", "A")),
  Meaning = c("very few individuals", "few individuals", "numerous individuals", "5 -- 25 %", "25 -- 50 %", "50 -- 75 %", "75 -- 100 %", "few individuals", "No presence"),
  Mean = c(1, 2, 3, 13, 38, 68, 88, 2, 0)
)

kbl(bbT, booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = "",
    col.names = linebreak(c("Scale", "Meaning", "Mean coverage [%]"), align = "c"),
    align = c("ccc")) |>
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```

In addition to abundance scale, **Turboveg** provides additional column for separation of growth form like trees, shrubs, herbs, etc. Layers and corresponding numbers are shown in table @tbl-layers.

There is a possibility to add additional fields to the database as well, where other attributes like micro location, flowering status, development status etc. can be stored. For analysis of these different species-plot attributes `vegdata` provides `tv.veg` function.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-layers
#| tbl-cap:  Turboveg layers definition
layers <- data.frame(
  No <- c(0:9),
  Name <-c("No layer", "Tree layer (high) (t1)", "Tree layer -middle- (t2)", "Tree layer -low- (t3)", "Shrub layer (high) (s1)", "Shrub layer -low- (s2)", "Herb layer (hl)", "Juvenile (jl)", "Seedling (<1 year) (sl)", "Moss layer (ml)")
  )

kbl(layers, booktabs = TRUE, 
    linesep = "",
    col.names = linebreak(c("Layer number", "Description"), align = "c"),
    align = c("cc")
    ) |>
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```

Let's load the library into R environment as usuall.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
library(vegdata)
```

As the `vegdata` internal functions extensively uses the directory structure of **Turboveg** the first thing is to set `tv_home`. `vegdata` package provides `tv.home()` function for it, which tries to find **Turboveg** installation path.[^2]

[^2]: It works for Windows, and Unix/Linux with `wine.`

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| message: TRUE
tv.home()
```

If you would like to change it, please declare it by setting `tv_home`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(tv_home="path_to_your_Turboveg_root_directory")
```
