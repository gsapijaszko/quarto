DEM, DTM or DSM? Three very similar concepts, but nevertheless representing different features. 

- DEM (Digital Elevation Model) represents the Earth surface, without any features (either man made, either natural).

- DTM (Digital Terrain Model) similar to DEM, however including all natural terrain features, like rivers and ridges. It's more detailed than DEM.

- DSM (Digital Surface Model) includes all features of the environment, like buildings, roads and trees.
