Three very similar concepts, but nevertheless representing different features. \n\n- DEM (Digital Elevation Model) represents the Earth surface, without any features (either man made, either natural).\n\n- DTM (Digital Terrain Model) similar to DEM, however including all natural terrain features, like rivers and ridges. It's more detailed than DEM.\n\n- DSM (Digital Surface Model) includes all features of the environment, like buildings, roads and trees.\n\n\n\n<!--\njsonlite::read_json(\"https://api.open-elevation.com/api/v1/lookup?locations=51.2606,16.8941\")\n# https://github.com/ajnisbet/opentopodata\njsonlite::read_json(\"https://api.opentopodata.org/v1/eudem25m?locations=51.2606,16.8941\")\nhttps://rdrr.io/github/edwardlavender/flapper/man/query_open_topo.html\n-->\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
