Three very similar concepts, but nevertheless representing different features. \n\n- DEM (Digital Elevation Model) represents the Earth surface, without any features (either man made, either natural).\n\n- DTM (Digital Terrain Model) similar to DEM, however including all natural terrain features, like rivers and ridges. It's more detailed than DEM.\n\n- DSM (Digital Surface Model) includes all features of the environment, like buildings, roads and trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
